# Katana Liveset Tweaker

Lets you change amp models in your exported Liveset `.tsl` files. Specifically, it lets you use the hidden "sneaky" amps in a relatively easy manner.

## To Use

If you want to build a copy yourself


## TODO

- Tests?
- See if it works in other browsers / OSes other than my own.
- Allow editing of other amp parameters (gain, volume, etc.) maybe.
