# Katana Liveset Tweaker

Lets you change amp models in your exported Liveset `.tsl` files. Specifically, it lets you use the hidden "sneaky" amps in a relatively easy manner.

## To Use

Go here: https://eskimospy.com/katana/

If you want to build a copy yourself, clone the repo and either:

`yarn`

or

`npm install`

depending on which you use.


## TODO

- See if it works in other browsers / OSes other than my own.
- Allow editing of other amp parameters (gain, volume, etc.) maybe.
